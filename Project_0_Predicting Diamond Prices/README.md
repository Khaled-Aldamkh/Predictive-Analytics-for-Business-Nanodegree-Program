# Project Details
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, the company’s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. You, as the business analysts, are tasked to apply that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.
# Data
### diamonds.csv 
contains carat, cut, clarity, and price information for each diamond in the dataset used to build the regression model.
### new_diamonds.csv 
ontains carat, cut, and clarity information for the diamonds the company would like to purchase.
