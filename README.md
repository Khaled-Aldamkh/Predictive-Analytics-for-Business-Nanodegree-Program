This repository contains projects of Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Predicting Diamond Prices
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. This project is about using the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

## Predicting Catalog Demand
This project is about analyzing a business problem in the mail-order catalog business, by predicting how much money the company can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers.

## Create an Analytical Dataset
Pawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state. This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. This project is about cleaning dataset to perform an analysis on it to recommend a city for Pawdacityâ€™s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.

## Predicting Default Risk
A young and small bank (been in operations for two years) needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not.

## A/B Test a New Menu Launch
Round Roasters, a coffee restaurant in the United States of America. The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. This project is about analyzing the A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the Round Roasters chain should launch this new menu.

## Combining Predictive Techniques
A company has 85 grocery stores and it is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. All stores use the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others. This project is about providing an analytical support to make decisions about store formats and inventory planning.
